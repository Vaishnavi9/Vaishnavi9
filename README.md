🌍 Vaishnavi Dhanwade

Hello! I’m Vaishnavi Dhanwade, a software developer with a little over 8 years of experience. Over the years, I’ve worked with Java, Spring Boot, Quarkus, React, and Python, and I’m gradually learning to think more in terms of systems and architecture rather than just code.

I enjoy solving problems step by step, experimenting with ideas, and building projects that teach me something new.

🔭 At the moment:

Exploring how to design reliable and scalable systems

Experimenting with real-time flight routing and delay monitoring

Learning more about cloud-native and event-driven architectures

Currently working on: ✈️ Flight Sentinel Ingestion Project

Tech stack: Python, FastAPI, Kafka, Docker, Fly.io

🌱 Beyond Work

Outside of tech, I spend time on things that keep me grounded and creative:

Practicing yoga & pranayama daily 🧘‍♀️

Exploring spirituality and creative arts 🎨

Running my YouTube channel where I share pieces of art and peace
